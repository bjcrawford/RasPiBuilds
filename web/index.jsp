                    The <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org" target="_blank">
                    Raspberry Pi</a> is a relatively cheap, wallet-sized computer 
                    that makes a great base for all kinds of DIY and maker type 
                    projects. The Pi can be connected to a monitor, keyboard, and 
                    mouse to be used just like a normal computer, but can function 
                    on its own (after being given a little code) with only a cell 
                    phone sized power supply. Its USB ports and 
                    <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/gpio/" target="_blank">
                    general purpose input/output</a> pins allow for a wide variety 
                    of components to be connected to the Raspberry Pi and a vast 
                    collection of programming 
                    <a href="http://elinux.org/RPi_Low-level_peripherals" target="_blank">
                    libraries</a> exist to allow communication between the Pi and 
                    these components.

                    This site aims to host a collection of Raspberry Pi inspired
                    project ideas. Additionally, we would like users to submit 
                    their own personal project <a href="assoc.jsp">builds</a> to 
                    show off their particular spin on the project or a novel new 
                    way of accomplishing a project detail. Generally, 
                    <a href="other.jsp">projects</a> will contain a rough
                    outline of the project's goals/requirements, supplies list, 
                    and approximate cost. Builds, on the other hand, will be 
                    submissions from users. Users are encouraged to be as detailed
                    as they want with regards the the build submissions.

                <h3>The Metamorphosis</h3>
                <p>
                    One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he 
                    found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. 
                    He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a 
                    little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and 
                    divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly 
                    able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. 
                    His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the 
                    rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's 
                    happened to me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a 
                    proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully 
                    between its four familiar walls. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    A collection of textile 
                    samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling 
                    salesman - and above it there hung a picture that he had 
                    recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a 
                    nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur 
                    hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff 
                    that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer. 
                    Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather. 
                    Drops of rain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him 
                    feel quite sad. "How about if I sleep a little bit longer and 
                    forget all this nonsense", he thought, but that was something 
                    he was unable to do because he was used to sleeping on his 
                    right, and in his present state couldn't get into that 
                    position. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    However hard he threw himself onto his right, he 
                    always rolled back to where he was. He must have tried it a 
                    hundred times, shut his eyes so that he wouldn't have to look 
                    at the floundering legs, and only stopped when he began to 
                    feel a mild, dull pain there that he had never felt before. 
                    "Oh, God", he thought, "what a strenuous career it is that 
                    I've chosen! Travelling day in and day out. Doing business 
                    like this takes much more effort than doing your own business 
                    at home, and on top of that there's the curse of travelling, 
                    worries about making train connections, bad and irregular 
                    food, contact with different people all the time so that you 
                    can never get to know anyone or become friendly with them. It 
                    can all go to Hell!" 
                </p>
                <p>
                    He felt a slight itch up on his belly; 
                    pushed himself slowly up on his back towards the headboard so 
                    that he could lift his head better; found where the itch was, 
                    and saw that it was covered with lots of little white spots 
                    which he didn't know what to make of; and when he tried to 
                    feel the place with one of his legs he drew it quickly back 
                    because as soon as he touched it he was overcome by a cold 
                    shudder. He slid back into his former position. "Getting up 
                    early all the time", he thought, "it makes you stupid. You've 
                    got to get enough sleep. Other travelling salesmen live a 
                    life of luxury. For instance, whenever I go back to the guest 
                    house during the morning to copy out the contract, these 
                    gentlemen are always still sitting there eating their 
                    breakfasts. 
                </p>
                <p>

                    I ought to just try that with my boss; I'd get 
                    kicked out on the spot. But who knows, maybe that would be 
                    the best thing for me. If I didn't have my parents to think 
                    about I'd have given in my notice a long time ago, I'd have 
                    gone up to the boss and told him just what I think, tell him 
                    everything I would, let him know just what I feel. He'd fall 
                    right off his desk! And it's a funny sort of business to be 
                    sitting up there at your desk, talking down at your 
                    subordinates from up there, especially when you have to go 
                    right up close because the boss is hard of hearing. Well, 
                    there's still some hope; once I've got the money together to 
                    pay off my parents' debt to him - another five or six years 
                    I suppose - that's definitely what I'll do. That's when I'll 
                    make the big change. First of
